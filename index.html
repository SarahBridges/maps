    <h1>Map Mistakes</h1>
    
    <h3>3D on 2D</h3>
    
    <p>One mistake Cairo discusses which people can make when creating visualization with maps is when they try to show a 
      globe on a flat surface. The maps consist of shape, area, angles, distance, and direction; but all of these aspects 
      cannot be accurate when mapping a 3D shape as a 2D shape. At most two of these aspects can be portrayed accurately and 
      at least three will be compromised. Depending on what you are trying to show with you map, you should consider which 
      aspects should be accurate or compromised in your visualization.</p>
    
    <h3>Scaling Circle</h3>
    
    <p>Another mistake Cairo discusses about map visualizations has to do with showing a quantity of people with a circle. When 
      you are showing differences in amount of people in different regions, circles are often used to show whether an area 
      has a small quantity of people associated with the data or a larger one. When scaling a circle, you need to be careful to 
      scale the area of the circle rather than any other measurement as this will protray the most accurate quantitative data 
      visualization.</p>
